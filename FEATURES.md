# ARMATURA — feature matrix + reference and competitor checklists

> Version wording: all crates are `0.1.0` (the first builds are the draft pre-release `v0.1.0-alpha.2`); "v0.5 / v0.6 / v0.7" in this repository are *feature levels* (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)), and `ROADMAP.md` section 9 is the authority on what is built.

Honest status of what exists. **✅ done & tested · 🟡 partial · ❌ not implemented.**

> Scope note: ARMATURA is an independently implemented engine (from public specifications and papers; competitor feature lists were consulted for scope; no third-party source code was copied; see CLEANROOM.md for the research disclosure), not a re-implementation of any
> commercial product, and it does **not** reach parity with a 25-year-old commercial suite
> (mature GUI, drawing tools, live input, 3D, ecosystem). The first tables are organised by
> capability; the **second half of this file** is a version-by-version checklist of the
> reference product's publicly documented features (sources listed at the end) with
> ARMATURA's status for each. "Innovations" are claimed only relative to the generic technique,
> not as proven absent from any other tool.

# ★ BUILD LADDER — from simple to complex, with copyright / IP status (feature level v0.7, 20-22 Oct 2026)

This section is the **single place to see what can be built, in what order, and whether it is safe**.
It supersedes the scattered "candidate #" lists further down; details and IDs live in `ROADMAP.md`
(R-xxx / I-xx), the clean-room method in `CLEANROOM.md`, licences in `LICENSING.md`.

**Status:** ✅ built & tested · 🟡 partly built · ⬜ planned (not started)
**IP status (after the alternatives of ROADMAP §8):**
🟢 safe — open standard, textbook maths, or our own design ·
🟠 safe *if* you keep a condition (stated in the last column) ·
🔴 do not build.
*Engineering screen, not legal advice; a lawyer should confirm every 🟠 before a commercial release.*

## Never build (🔴)
- Reading or writing native **Live2D, Spine, Moho, Harmony, Rive, Cartoon Animator** project files (proprietary; EULA/reverse-engineering exposure) — use Lottie, OCA, ORA, APNG, SVG instead.
- **ARAP-style fast artwork-deformation solvers** as described in Adobe's patents — pin warp, FFD and skinning cover the use case.
- Copying any vendor's **UI layout, icons, names, sample content or file-format magic numbers/terminology**.
- Mimicking the **Harding** photosensitivity tool or claiming broadcast compliance.
- Bundling **H.264/H.265/AAC encoders**.

## Conditions that apply to every 🟢 row
Provenance log kept (`CLEANROOM.md`; independent implementation, not a strict clean-room); only permissive dependencies (regenerate with `scripts/licence-audit.sh`; currently 362 third-party crates over all platforms, all MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD / Zlib / Unlicense-class except six MPL-2.0 crates (smartstring via the `scripting` feature, which is on by default, and five via the window app `armatura-gui`); see docs/THIRD_PARTY.md); no third-party artwork or audio shipped without its own licence file; the name **ARMATURA** cleared in a trademark search before launch.

## Things that are modest "improvements" over the textbook baseline
(not claimed to be absent elsewhere)
- Every project edit is a validated, invertible JSON patch → undo can never corrupt a project.
- All simulation (springs, particles) is random-access deterministic: scrub or render any frame in any order, get identical pixels.
- Any property — including deformer control points and morph weights — is addressable by one `layer::sub::id` path, so expressions and driven curves can wire anything to anything.
- Validation reports *all* problems in one pass with the offending names.
- One engine → SVG, raster, GIF, MP4, HTML, Lottie; the same `evaluate(frame)` feeds all.

## Tests
`cargo test` — 142 unit/integration tests (math, tracks, expressions, rig solvers, deformers,
rendering pixels, exporters, editor undo/redo, audio, particles, booleans, metaballs).

## Roll-up (reference product only; competitors follow below)
Of the reference product's documented features, ARMATURA covers the **rigging, deformation,
procedural-animation, compositing-math and export** core (roughly: skeleton/IK/constraints,
mesh & lattice deformation, keyframes & expressions, masks/blends/gradients, particles,
metaballs/booleans, GIF/MP4/HTML/Lottie), but it has **no drawing tools, no live input, no 3D,
no PSD/FBX I/O** (at the time of the first survey; glTF export, EXR output, Rhai scripting, a graph/timeline studio, onion skin and blur effects have been added since, see `ROADMAP.md` section 9).
Those are the large, mostly GUI-bound blocks of the product and are the honest gap.

# Addendum — Social networks and community channels (round 5, 2026-10-19)

**Access reality:** X/Twitter pages are blocked to fetching by robots.txt (only search-result snippets/titles are visible); Facebook likewise; Reddit searches with a domain filter were rejected by the search proxy and unfiltered searches returned no Reddit threads; the Lost Marble forum serves a JavaScript redirect shell with no readable content. Nothing was circumvented. What was readable:

## Moho official channels (moho.lostmarble.com news, X snippets)
| Item | Notes | ARMATURA |
|---|---|---|
| Moho 13.5.3 (Apr 2022) | improved automatic lip-sync, better interface, less intrusive bones | ✅ lip-sync (WAV heuristic) |
| Moho 13.5.5 (X, May 2022) | **Relative Paths** for linked assets | ✅ asset dir is relative |
| Moho 14.3 "Mantis Shrimp" (Dec 2024) | brush-focused update | ❌ |
| Moho 14.4 "Side Quest" (Nov 2025) | export to game engines and 3D software | 🟡 Lottie/own JSON; glTF/FBX ❌ |
| Moho 14.5 "Showtime" (Oct 2026) | magnetic onion skins, Shift & Trace, Liquid Shapes options, EXR/PNG with colour profiles, live-playback mode for streaming/controlling characters in real time | see main matrix; live mode ❌ |
| Ambassador Program (Jun 2026); official stance: no AI tools planned (Mar 2025) | policy | n/a — ARMATURA also has no AI features |
| Webinars (Víctor Paredes, etc.) | tutorials | n/a |

## Community comparisons (Spine forum, "Spine vs Moho 12")
- Users praise in Moho: built-in physics, layer masking, smart bones, vector editing.
- Users criticise: FFD considered weak; **no real runtime**, game export limited to FBX.
- Creature praised for integrated motion capture (FFD criticised).
- Spine 4.2 physics constraints get enthusiastic reactions on X (user posts).
ARMATURA: physics ✅ (baked springs), masking 🟡 (clip via booleans), smart bones 🟡, vector editing ✅, runtime ❌, mocap ❌.

## Forum wish-list titles seen (content not readable)
"Concentrate on Timeline/Workflow improvements" (2024), "Road map for Moho", "Help Shape the Future of Anime Studio", "13.5.2 performance issue" — suggests timeline/workflow and performance are the most-requested areas; not a verified feature list.

## Roadmap additions
43. Real-time live-playback / streaming mode (WebSocket pose input → rendered frames) — Moho 14.5
44. Runtime library in a small portable language (WASM build of the evaluator) — most-cited Moho weakness
45. Layer masking as a first-class layer type (not only boolean ops)
46. Timeline/workflow ergonomics in the studio (graph editor, multi-select keys) — community wish-lists

# Addendum — Wishlists and feature-request boards (round 6, 2026-10-19)

Only requests actually readable are listed. "ARMATURA" column = whether the request is something the engine already covers.

## Moho (Lost Marble forum)
Readable: the forum index only. Sections "Feature Request Discussions" and "Unofficial Bug Reports and Feature Requests" exist; latest visible request title: **"Dock Windows – Custom Interface"** (18 Oct 2026). The long-running "Help Shape the Future of Anime Studio" thread (828 replies, 2011–2021) and other wish-list threads ("Road map for Moho", "My wish for Moho in 2024 – Concentrate on Timeline/Workflow improvements", "Request for top 10 Anime Studio Pro 6 features") are JavaScript-redirect shells → content not readable. Specific forum-to-forum comparisons (Spine forum): physics, masking, smart bones wanted in Spine; Moho criticised for weak FFD and no runtime.
| Request | ARMATURA |
|---|---|
| Dockable windows / custom interface | ❌ (web studio fixed layout) |
| Timeline / workflow improvements | 🟡 |
| Real runtime for games | ❌ |
| Stronger FFD | ✅ Bernstein lattice + mesh |

## Cartoon Animator (Reallusion Feedback Tracker + wish-list thread)
| Request (votes where shown) | ARMATURA |
|---|---|
| Default keyframe curve in preferences | ✅ per-key easing |
| Multi-channel keyframe editing | 🟡 patch batch ops |

| Live drawing layer / dynamic editable props (18) | ❌ |
| Hitbox and physics (14) | 🟡 springs |
| Transparent MOV import (14) | ❌ |
| 360° panorama (5); AI integration ideas (6) | ❌ |

## Live2D Cubism Editor feature-request board (30 threads, 2023–2026)
| Request | ARMATURA |
|---|---|
| Linux support | ✅ |
| Keyboard shortcuts in manual mesh edit | n/a |
| Blendshape limit down to −100% | ✅ morphs unbounded |
| Proportional resizing; gravity tool; mesh-to-mesh lock | ❌ / ❌ / ❌ |

| Optional drawables in CDI3 spec | n/a |

## Toon Boom Harmony
The user forum is closed and redirects to Discord (not searchable); the old "Feature Requests board" threads ("One can only dream: A Feature List", "Software Upgrade Suggestions Part 2", "Bitmap Layer Overhaul LONG OVERDUE", "Various Quality of Life suggestions") show only the closure notice. No requests recoverable.

## Synfig (GSoC ideas list 2019–2022, linked GitHub issue numbers)
| Request | ARMATURA |
|---|---|
| Copy/paste waypoints (#2139) | ✅ keys via ops |
| Ctrl+Tab tab switching, window shortcuts, playback-area selection, properties search, rulers toggle, mouse-driven parameter change | ❌ (GUI) |
| Performance: faster render/export; cache layer parameters; incremental render-task tree | ✅ pure-function evaluate; no cache ❌ |
| Port GTK 4, Conan/vcpkg builds | n/a |

## Spine
Requests go to the forum and are moved to a public Trello board (not fetchable: robots.txt). From the forum: highest priority historically is editor stability and runtime updates. Kickstarter-era plan (meshes → FFD → skinning → IK pinning) is now fully shipped, so ARMATURA's mesh/FFD/skinning are at parity with that old list; IK pinning ✅ (Pin constraint). Recent forum request titles: support for latest three.js / React Three Fiber; Spine 4.3 support in Defold.

## Rive
Public roadmap = "Feature Requests channel" with status labels (in progress / planned / launched); needs login to read. Nothing recoverable beyond release notes (round 4).

## OpenToonz, TVPaint, Pencil2D
GitHub (OpenToonz/Synfig) pages are blocked by robots.txt; no readable TVPaint board found; a Pencil2D "Feature requests to add" thread exists but was not opened (out of scope).

## Roadmap additions from wishlists
47. Auto-animate / procedural idle layer (breathing, blink, head sway with rarity & intensity) — CA wish #20; builds on existing wobble
48. Camera depth-of-field and blur filter — CA
49. Lights (spot/ambient) with cast shadows for image layers — CA
50. Align / distribute operations (editor op) — CA
51. Channel colour-coding and "shy" channel visibility in the studio — CA

# Addendum — Open-source projects on git platforms (round 7, 2026-10-19)

**Access:** GitHub's search API is not available in this environment ("sessions are bound to their configured repositories"), so projects were found via web search and read from their public READMEs. GitLab and Codeberg APIs are blocked by the proxy; Codeberg/GitLab pages appeared only in search results (Friction was readable). Star counts could not be retrieved. Several projects are very new/early — features listed are as claimed in READMEs, not verified by running them.

## Ideas worth adopting (new roadmap candidates)
59. **MCP server / agent API** over the patch-op editor so AI assistants can rig and animate (Rigby2D, Iki) — fits ARMATURA's JSON-patch architecture
60. **Standard parameter IDs** (ParamAngleX, EyeOpen, MouthOpen…) so any host can drive a model (Iki)
61. **Auto-rigger from role-named layers**: blink, gaze, head turn/nod/tilt, brows, breathing, hair physics (Iki)
62. **Auto eye clipping** (iris masked by eye shape) (Stretchy Studio) — via Boolean layer
63. **Slider constraint** and **path constraint** (Rigby2D, Spine)
64. **Soft / stretchy / compress / uniform IK** modes (rig2d)
65. **Weight tools**: smooth, normalise, limit-to-N, copy, bone locking, brush blend modes (rig2d, Ankhimate)
66. **Mesh silhouette tracing from alpha** (Ankhimate)
67. **Per-bone visibility ranges** (Skeletal-Animator)
68. **Transparent-background video export (WebM/MOV with alpha) and spritesheet PNG+JSON** (Skeletal-Animator)
69. **Export template engine** (user-defined output formats) (Ankhimate)
70. **dotLottie `.lottie` container + runtime slots/theming + state machines** (dotlottie-rs)
71. **Model diff / dump / convert CLI** (`armatura diff a.json b.json`) (Umamo)
72. **Command palette + rebindable shortcuts** in the studio (Umamo)
73. **Fuzzed loader, panic-free runtime path, latency benchmarks** (Ayatsuri2D) — robustness hardening of `Engine::new`
74. **Spine JSON import/export** for interchange (Rigby2D, rig2d, Stretchy Studio)
75. **Shelf atlas packer** for image layers (rig2d, Rigby2D)
76. **Events with keyed values and audio cues** on the timeline (Rigby2D, Ankhimate)

| VBridger, Vitamins | Steam tools around VTubing; not evaluated | — |

## After Effects rigging ecosystem (School of Motion review)
| Feature | Source | ARMATURA |
|---|---|---|
| **Joystick controller** (5 key poses: origin/right/left/top/bottom) interpolated in 2D | Joysticks 'n Sliders | ❌ — strong candidate |
| **Sliders** mixing unlimited poses | JnS, Duik | 🟡 morph channels |
| Structures (bones independent of artwork, reusable), autorig | Duik Bassel | ✅ |
| Controllers: slider, 2D slider, angle | Duik | ❌ |

## Competing / alternative apps (AlternativeTo, Wikipedia list as of 2026)
Tahoma2D (OpenToonz fork, stop-motion), TupiTube, enve (discontinued; became Friction), Expressive Animator (interactive SVG), Cavalry, Jitter (web motion design), Blazy (Figma → animation, CSS/React export), Animation Desk, Pivot Animator, FlipaClip, Krita animation, Blender (Mar 2026), Clip Studio Paint (animation), Adobe Character Animator (webcam puppeteering; "what's new" page blocked by robots.txt), Adobe Animate (last release listed Oct 2023), CrazyTalk, DigiCel FlipBook, Apple Motion, RETAS. None add rigging features beyond what earlier rounds cover; new ideas: **Figma/design-tool → animation presets with CSS/React export** (Blazy) and **webcam puppeteering** (Character Animator, VTube Studio).

## Academic and patent literature (titles/abstracts only)
- Jacobson et al. 2011, **Bounded Biharmonic Weights** for real-time deformation — automatic smooth skinning weights from a cage/skeleton ✅ idea: improve `auto_skin` (currently distance-based).
- Adobe patents US9865073 / US10078910, **"Computer animation of artwork using fast 2-dimensional deformation solving"** (Character Animator's mesh warp). *Clean-room note:* ARMATURA uses Bernstein FFD and weighted skinning, not that patented solver; any future ARAP-style solver should be reviewed with counsel. This is not legal advice.
- arXiv 2025–26 auto-rigging: **ASMR** (3D mesh skeleton + skin via 2D generative priors), UniRig, "How to Train Your Dragon" (diffusion rigging), HumanRig, SPRig, UniMate — all 3D/ML; relevant only as a future "auto-rig suggestion" feature.
- Stony Brook TVC 2017 **automatic skinning weight retargeting** — copy weights between meshes (✅ roadmap: weight copy).

## New roadmap candidates from this round
78. **Joystick controller**: 2D control point blending 5 key poses (and N-pose variants) → drives any channels — JnS / Duik / Live2D parameters
79. Mocap import (BVH) + auto-match skeleton + in-place loop conversion + foot-lock IK — Mocap2D

Adobe's own "what's new" index returns 2023 and 2026 only; 24.x and 25.x are listed by Wikipedia as stability-only releases.

## Concept
Layered Photoshop/Illustrator art (also EPS/SVG since Oct 2018) becomes a **puppet** rigged automatically from **layer names/tags**; performance is captured live (webcam face/body, microphone, keyboard, mouse, MIDI) as **takes** on a timeline; outputs go to PNG sequences, WAV, Media Encoder (incl. **video with alpha**), Dynamic Link to After Effects / Premiere, and live Syphon / Mercury Transmit. Starter mode is free; Pro needs Creative Cloud.

## Behaviors (full list from Adobe Help)
| Behavior | What it does | ARMATURA |
|---|---|---|
| **Face** | head, eyes, brows, nose, mouth from webcam; parallax and head-position strength | ❌ (no live tracking) — roadmap #88 |
| **Body** (Body Tracker, Sensei AI, 22.0) | arms, torso, legs from webcam | ❌ |
| **Lip Sync** | mouth visemes from voice; transcript-assisted accuracy (22.1); engine 3.4 better F, W-Oo, fewer L/M | 🟡 WAV → 5 visemes ✅; transcript alignment ❌ |
| **Nutcracker Jaw** | lower jaw from face/voice | ❌ |
| **Eye Gaze** | pupils move independently | ✅ aim constraints/channels |
| **Head & Body Turner** | swaps layer groups (front, quarter, side) as head/body rotate | 🟡 Switch layers ✅; no angle-driven auto swap |
| **Walk** | walk cycle, run, pose emphasis, shoulder/hip sway, **Pin Feet When Standing** (3.4/3.5) | ✅ walk generator; ❌ pin-feet |
| **Limb IK** (ex Arm IK) | bend direction + stretch for arms and legs | 🟡 2-bone IK ✅; stretch ❌ |
| **Leader/Follower** (22.5) | shapes how limbs bend/stretch | ❌ |
| **Dragger** | mouse/touch moves a region | ❌ (studio is not interactive on canvas) |
| **Physics / Dangle** | swing, collision, gravity, wind; squash & stretch, damping | 🟡 springs ✅; collision/wind ❌ |
| **Magnets** | handles snap together by proximity | ❌ |
| **Particles** | emits physics objects (snow, cannon fire) | ✅ emitter |
| **Motion Lines** | trailing lines behind fast objects | ❌ |
| **Wiggler** | wobble on vector art | ✅ wobble/boil |
| **Breath** | breathing motion | 🟡 manual channel; roadmap #61 |
| **Auto Blink** | automatic blinks / layer flicker | ❌ (roadmap #61) |
| **Motion Library** (23.0, 350+ motions, strength param 23.1) | apply full-body animations | 🟡 walk only; ❌ library |
| **Cycle Layers** | step through layers in a group | 🟡 Switch layers ✅; frame-cycling ❌ |
| **Layer Picker / Motion Trigger / Fader** | show a layer; switch by motion direction; fade on trigger | 🟡 |
| **Transform** | move/scale/rotate/opacity of handles | ✅ |
| **Handle Fixer** | lock parts of a mesh | ✅ pins |
| **Triggers** | key-press shows layers/gestures; **Controls panel** with sliders, angle dials, buttons, MIDI mapping | ❌ — roadmap #80 |
| **Collide, Dynamic, Cycle Pause, Auto-swap (22.5)** | tags/behaviors for physics and frame-like swaps | ❌ |

## Timeline, recording, and workflow features
| Feature | Version | ARMATURA |
|---|---|---|
| Takes, replays (reusable triggerable recordings), smart replays, editable replays | 2.0 / 22.0 / 23.6 | 🟡 clips ✅; replays ❌ |
| Keyframes, time stretching of keyframes, scene cameras, triggerable audio | 3.0 / 3.2 | ✅ keys/camera; ❌ triggerable audio |
| Speech-Aware Animation (head/brow motion from voice, Sensei) | 3.4 | ❌ — roadmap #61 |
| Merge/sequence takes; coloured take rows; search filters (`kind:` `shared:` `armed:`); shy rows; collapse takes | 3.4 | ❌ |
| Snap to frames / objects; timeline snapping | 3.5 | ❌ |
| Work-area ops: ripple delete, insert time, loop, trim, export | 2.0 | 🟡 clip ops ✅ |
| Rigging issues pane; tag & trigger search | 3.0 | ✅ validation collects all errors |
| History bookmarks; automatic damaged-project recovery (4.2); new compact/corruption-resistant file format (4.0) | | 🟡 undo ✅; recovery ❌ |
| Puppet Maker (templates: hair, skin, accessories) | 22.1.1 | ❌ |
| Characterizer (turn a photo/painting into a puppet) | 2.0 | ❌ |
| Quick Export for social sharing | 22.5 | 🟡 GIF/MP4 ✅ |
| Scene snapshots, recording countdown, custom control button art | 1.5 | ❌ |
| Camera selection, multi-monitor, HiDPI | 2.0 | n/a |
| Live output (Syphon, Mercury Transmit), Twitch Character Trigger extension | 1.1 / 2.1 | ❌ — roadmap #43 |
| MIDI, scripts via V8 (JavaScript) | 1.1 / 2.0 | ❌ — roadmap #31 |
| Share/publish puppets, shareable puppet files | Beta 5 | 🟡 JSON portable |
| Dynamic Link to AE / Premiere | Beta 5 | ❌ |
| Weaknesses reported (review): steep learning curve, hardware (webcam/mic) dependence, long character-prep time, paid Pro, trigger setup complexity | | opportunity: ARMATURA deterministic offline pipeline, CLI/JSON |

## What stands out for ARMATURA (new roadmap candidates)
89. **Tag-based auto-rig from layer names** (head, eyes, brows, mouth visemes, arm/leg tags) — Character Animator core idea; extends roadmap #61
90. **Takes & replays**: record parameter performance as reusable, triggerable clips with blend easing
91. **Pin Feet When Standing** and ground-contact lock for walk generator
92. **Leader/Follower** limb stretch behaviors; **Magnets**; **Motion Lines**
93. **Motion Library** format (named motion clips with strength 0-100%) 
94. **Head & Body Turner**: auto-swap view groups from a yaw angle channel
95. **Transcript-assisted lip-sync** (forced alignment of text to WAV phonemes)
96. **Speech-aware head/brow motion** from audio energy and pauses
97. **Video-with-alpha export** (ProRes 4444 / WebM VP9 alpha) — also in Skeletal-Animator (roadmap #68)
98. **Triggerable audio** and audio-reactive parameters
