# OSATURA

**A 2D vector rigging and animation engine in Rust: bones, IK, skinning, deformers, a state machine runtime, a command-line toolbox, a browser studio and embeddable libraries, in one workspace.** Romanian version: [README.ro.md](README.ro.md).

## Summary and philosophy

OSATURA lets you build a character or a scene from vector shapes and images, rig it with bones and constraints, animate it with keys, clips and physics, and send it out as GIF, video, Lottie, glTF, a self-contained HTML player or an interactive runtime. It is made of small, deterministic pieces: the same project and the same seed give the same pixels, every tool reads and writes a documented JSON project, and every command works from a terminal, so animation can be scripted, reviewed, diffed and tested like source code.

Principles that shape the project:

* **Independent implementation.** Written from public specifications, papers and textbook mathematics. Competitor feature lists were consulted for *scope*; no third-party source code was copied, and the project neither reads nor writes any proprietary format. It is not a strict clean-room process (see [CLEANROOM.md](CLEANROOM.md), including its research disclosure) and it is not affiliated with, derived from or compatible with Moho or any other commercial product. Code was largely written with an AI model.
* **Honest status.** Every feature is described together with what it does *not* do ([docs/LIMITATIONS.md](docs/LIMITATIONS.md), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) section 9).
* **Safe by default.** No panics on input, finite-value checks, resource caps, atomic writes, asset paths confined to the project folder ([docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)).
* **Open formats first.** OpenRaster, OCA, SVG, Lottie, glTF, APNG, WebM, EXR; no proprietary file formats by design.
* **Small dependency footprint** with a licence policy checked by tests and `cargo deny`.

## Status

*Name: the project was called ARMATURA until 24 Oct 2026 and was renamed OSATURA after a trademark search ([docs/LIMITATIONS.md](docs/LIMITATIONS.md) L-78). The repository and the site address were renamed too (old repository links redirect).*

> **Alpha. First builds prepared as a draft pre-release: `v0.1.0-alpha.3`.** The executables for Windows x86-64, macOS arm64 and Linux x86-64 and the WebAssembly module are built by GitHub Actions and attached to a *draft* pre-release on <https://github.com/chiuta/osatura/releases> (a draft is visible only to the owner until it is published by hand). All crates are still version `0.1.0`; "v0.5 / v0.6 / v0.7" are *feature levels* in the history, not release numbers ([CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).
>
> | Verified | Not verified |
> |---|---|
> | **Local (Linux x86-64, 24 Oct 2026):** 1338 tests of `cargo test --workspace --exclude osatura-gpu --exclude osatura-gui` plus 19 doc-tests pass (the GPU crate needs an adapter and the window crate a desktop; before this the count including the GPU crate was 1368). **On GitHub Actions (24 Oct 2026, toolchain 1.97.0):** the test suite and `clippy -D warnings` pass on Linux, macOS (arm64) and Windows; `cargo deny` and `reuse lint` pass; the WebAssembly module builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and the wrapper's test passes against the real module under Node 20; the release binaries pass a smoke test (`--version`, `demo`, `check`, `render`) and `osatura-studio --selftest` runs on Windows and macOS. Four headless-Chromium smoke tests of the studio pass; the CLI, the Rust facade and the C ABI (also under ASan/UBSan) were run with the examples in the docs | **No person has used the executables on a real Windows or macOS desktop**: the Windows double-click launcher and the `osatura-studio` window app (WebView2 / WKWebView) were only compiled and self-tested in CI; the binaries are **not code-signed** (SmartScreen "Unknown publisher", macOS Gatekeeper); the Linux binary was built on an Ubuntu runner only; **the WebAssembly module has never been run in a browser** and its speed and memory are unmeasured; the studio was never used by a person in production, nor in a browser other than Chromium; no real GPU (only a software adapter), webcam, photograph or motion-capture file was ever used; no security audit, lawyer review or patent search |

## Download

Prebuilt archives, once the owner has published the draft release, are on the project's [Releases page](https://github.com/chiuta/osatura/releases):

| Archive | Contents |
|---|---|
| `osatura-windows-x86_64.zip` | `osatura.exe` (command line + studio server), `osatura-studio.exe` (window app), C library and header, licences, third-party notices |
| `osatura-macos-arm64.tar.gz` | `osatura`, `osatura-studio` (Apple-silicon only), C library and header, licences, notices |
| `osatura-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | `osatura`, C library and header, licences, notices (no window app: use `osatura studio` and a browser) |
| `osatura-web.tar.gz` | `osatura_wasm.wasm`, `osatura.js`, demo `index.html` (unverified in browsers, see [docs/WASM.md](docs/WASM.md)) |

## Quick start

Requirements: a recent stable Rust toolchain (or a prebuilt archive from the [Download](#download) section: skip the `cargo build` line and use the unpacked `osatura`). `ffmpeg` is needed only for MP4/WebM export and for mp3/ogg audio; it is never bundled. Every command below was run for this README (debug build, Linux). Release builds (`cargo build --release`) are much faster for rendering and are used the same way with `target/release`.

```sh
cargo build -p osatura-cli                       # builds target/debug/osatura
export PATH="$PWD/target/debug:$PATH"             # so that `osatura` is found

osatura --version                                # version, licence, source offer, support links
osatura demo demo.json                           # write the built-in rig demo (640x480, 48 frames)
osatura check demo.json                          # validate: ok: 'OSATURA demo' 640x480 @ 24 fps, 48 frames, 6 bones...
osatura lint demo.json                           # static rig/animation checks: 0 finding(s), 0 error(s)
osatura render demo.json 12 frame12.png --bones  # one frame, with the skeleton overlay
osatura render demo.json 12 frame12.svg          # the same frame as vector output
osatura frames demo.json frames_out --png        # every frame as a PNG
osatura export demo.json demo.gif                # also .html (player), .json (Lottie), .lottie, .mp4 (ffmpeg)
osatura demo-fx fx.json                          # second demo: liquid, booleans, particles
osatura lipsync demo.json voice.wav mouth out.json   # mouth shapes from a WAV file (switch layer "mouth")
osatura studio demo.json --port 8080             # browser editor at http://127.0.0.1:8080
osatura ci init demo.json && osatura ci run     # animation CI: goldens + checks (about 40 s in a debug build)
```

`voice.wav` is any mono or stereo WAV file you provide. The studio listens on `127.0.0.1` only and refuses requests for other host names; to share it, read [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) first.

Use the libraries:

```sh
cargo build -p osatura-capi                      # target/debug/libosatura_capi.so and .a
gcc -std=c99 -o smoke osatura-capi/tests/smoke.c -Ltarget/debug -losatura_capi
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=target/debug ./smoke demo.json    # abi 1, 48 frames, 320x240, rc=0, checksum=...
```

The Rust facade is `osatura_core::prelude` ([docs/API.md](docs/API.md)); more C and Python examples are in [docs/C_ABI.md](docs/C_ABI.md).

Tests (about 14 minutes in a debug build on a shared machine; see [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)):

```sh
cargo test --workspace
cargo test --doc -p osatura-core
cargo test -p osatura-cli --test spdx_audit
```

## Licence summary

* **MPL-2.0** for the libraries `osatura-core`, `osatura-capi`, `osatura-wasm`, `osatura-gpu` and for `scripts/`: you may link them into your own program, open or closed; changes to those files must be published under the MPL.
* **AGPL-3.0-or-later** for `osatura-cli` (the command line and the studio) and `osatura-gui` (the window around it). If you modify it and let others interact with it over a network, section 13 requires you to offer them your source: `osatura studio --source-url URL` publishes where it is; `/source` and `osatura --version` carry the offer.
* **CC-BY-4.0** for documentation and synthetic assets (the synthetic face-detector model included).
* **Your projects and renders stay yours.**
* The name and logo are not covered by these licences ([TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md)). Patent status is not assessed ([docs/PATENT_NOTES.md](docs/PATENT_NOTES.md)). A commercial or dual licence for contributed code is not possible without a contributor licence agreement, and none exists.
* Third-party crates: 363 in the 24 Oct 2026 inventory (all platforms and targets together, which includes the window app's Windows / macOS / Linux-only crates; a given binary contains a subset), all permissive except six weak-copyleft MPL-2.0 crates: `smartstring` behind the optional `scripting` feature, and five (`cssparser`, `cssparser-macros`, `dtoa-short`, `selectors`, `option-ext`) that only the window app `osatura-gui` can pull in ([docs/THIRD_PARTY.md](docs/THIRD_PARTY.md)). ffmpeg is never bundled.

See [LICENSE](LICENSE), [LICENSES/](LICENSES/) and [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md). None of this is legal advice; a lawyer review is still outstanding.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome under the licence of the part they change. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (every commit needs a `Signed-off-by` line, DCO 1.1), [CLEANROOM.md](CLEANROOM.md) (implement from public sources only; do not copy from proprietary or incompatibly licensed code) and [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) (conventions, checklist for a new module, tests). Good first contributions: a fix from [docs/LIMITATIONS.md](docs/LIMITATIONS.md), a real run of the WebAssembly checklist, a real-desktop test of the Windows / macOS executables, a real-GPU benchmark.

Security issues: do not open a public issue; follow [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) section 10.
