# OSATURA documentation index

*Start here to find the right page. All documents are English Markdown under CC-BY-4.0, except the generated third-party files (see their headers). The Romanian README is [../README.ro.md](../README.ro.md).*

OSATURA is a 2D vector rigging and animation engine in Rust. It is an alpha project (the first builds are prepared as the draft pre-release `v0.1.0-alpha.3`; crates are still 0.1.0); read [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md) before depending on a feature.

## Reading paths by audience

Each path is an order, not a requirement. Stop when you have what you need.

**New user (wants to see it work).** [../README.md](../README.md) (quick start) -> [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) -> [STUDIO.md](STUDIO.md) -> [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) -> [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md).

**Rigger.** GETTING_STARTED -> [RIGGING_GUIDE.md](RIGGING_GUIDE.md) -> [PROJECT_FORMAT.md](PROJECT_FORMAT.md) (for the fields you edit by hand) -> [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) -> [CLI_REFERENCE.md](CLI_REFERENCE.md) (the `lint`, `check`, `fuzz`, `autorig`, `machine` commands) -> [CI.md](CI.md) to guard the rig.

**Animator.** GETTING_STARTED -> STUDIO -> [ANIMATION_GUIDE.md](ANIMATION_GUIDE.md) -> [EXPORT_FORMATS.md](EXPORT_FORMATS.md) (choose the output format) -> CLI_REFERENCE (`export`, `export-fit`).

**Pipeline or tools developer (scripts, other formats).** CLI_REFERENCE -> PROJECT_FORMAT -> EXPORT_FORMATS -> [CI.md](CI.md) -> [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) sections 4 to 7 (asset and file rules).

**Integrator (embedding the engine).** [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) overview -> choose the layer: Rust ([API.md](API.md)), C and other languages ([C_ABI.md](C_ABI.md)), browser ([WASM.md](WASM.md), read the status box first) -> [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md) sections 1 and 8 -> [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) section 8.

**Contributor.** [../CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) (DCO) -> [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) -> ARCHITECTURE -> [../CLEANROOM.md](../CLEANROOM.md) -> [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) section 9 (what exists and does not) -> LIMITATIONS (pick something to fix).

**Security reviewer or deployer.** [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) -> [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) section 3 (what is tested) -> LIMITATIONS section 2 and 11 -> `osatura-cli/src/http.rs`, `studio.rs`, `collab_srv.rs`, `osatura-core/src/assets.rs`, `fsutil.rs` -> [CI.md](CI.md) limits.

**Licensee, packager or lawyer.** [../LICENSING.md](../LICENSING.md) -> [../LICENSE](../LICENSE) and [../LICENSES/](../LICENSES/) -> [THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md) -> [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) -> [PATENT_NOTES.md](PATENT_NOTES.md) -> [../TRADEMARK.md](../TRADEMARK.md) -> [../CLEANROOM.md](../CLEANROOM.md) -> release checklist in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) section 7.

**Maintainer making a release.** DEVELOPMENT section 7 -> [../CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) -> LIMITATIONS (update) -> README status box.

## Where each question is answered

| Question | Page |
|---|---|
| How do I install and make my first animation? | GETTING_STARTED |
| What does command X do? | CLI_REFERENCE |
| What does this field in the JSON mean? | PROJECT_FORMAT, GLOSSARY |
| Which export format keeps masks / gradients / audio? | EXPORT_FORMATS |
| Can I use it from Python / C / the browser? | C_ABI / WASM (status!) |
| Is it safe to expose the studio to a network? | SECURITY section 11 |
| Why does X not work? Is it known? | LIMITATIONS, FAQ |
| How is it built and tested? | DEVELOPMENT |
| Can I use it commercially? What are the licences? | README (licence), LICENSING, THIRD_PARTY |
| What changed? | CHANGELOG, ROADMAP section 9 |

## Conventions used in the documents

* **"Verified"** means a command or program was run while the documents were written, in an environment with Linux x86-64, no GPU, no webcam and only headless Chromium. **"Not tested"** means exactly that. Statements about WebAssembly in a real engine are always unverified.
* Code samples in API.md and C_ABI.md are the programs that were compiled and run; samples in WASM.md ran only against the JavaScript mock.
* Section 9 of the ROADMAP is the authority for what a feature does and does not do. If a document disagrees with it or with the code, the code wins; please report the difference.
* Paths are relative to the repository root unless they start with `docs/`.
* Numbers (test counts, limits) come from the source or from a run on 22 Oct 2026 and may be out of date after the next change; the source is authoritative.
