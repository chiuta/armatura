# ARMATURA glossary

Domain terms used in the code and documentation, in alphabetical order. "See" points to the
module (in `armatura-core/src` unless stated) or document where the term is implemented or
specified. Documents: [PROJECT_FORMAT.md](PROJECT_FORMAT.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
Sources for techniques are listed in `CLEANROOM.md`.

**Aim constraint.** A constraint that rotates a bone so its +x axis points at another bone's head,
plus an offset. See `rig`; PROJECT_FORMAT section 4.3.

**Anchor.** A point on a Bezier path with a position and optional in and out handles; it may also
carry bone weights. See `path`; PROJECT_FORMAT section 6.

**Angle limits.** Per-bone minimum and maximum of the animated rotation, in degrees, enforced after
channels and after each IK chain. See `rig`, `engine`.

**API version.** The version of the stable Rust surface (`api` and `prelude`), currently 1.4.0,
checked by a snapshot test. Not the same as the file `format` or the C `ABI_VERSION`. See `api`.

**Asset.** A file referenced by a project (image, normal map, sound). Paths must be relative and stay
inside the project directory unless `--allow-external-assets` is given. See `assets`; PROJECT_FORMAT
section 18.

**Bake.** To compute values over time and store them as ordinary channels or keys, so that they no
longer need the computing tool. Used by physics, clips, magnet, footlock, state machines and more. See
ARCHITECTURE section 4.

**Bend.** The sign (+1 or -1) that picks which way a two-bone IK chain folds, such as elbow in or out.
See `rig`.

**Bezier curve.** A parametric cubic curve defined by two anchors and their handles. Flattened to line
segments (de Casteljau subdivision) for filling and measuring. See `path`.

**Binding.** A run-time rule that maps an external value (a game variable, a slider) through an
expression, a remap and smoothing onto a property or a state-machine input. See `binding`.

**Blend mode.** How a layer's colour combines with what is beneath it (multiply, screen, overlay and
so on). Formulas follow W3C Compositing and Blending Level 1. See `raster`, `fraster`.

**Blend tree.** A 1-D blend of several clips controlled by a number input, used inside a state
machine. See `machine`.

**Blob.** One circle of a liquid (metaball) layer. See `fx`.

**Bone.** A named segment of the skeleton with a head position, length, rest angle and optional
parent. Bones drive skinned geometry and attached layers. See `rig`; PROJECT_FORMAT section 4.

**Boolean layer.** A layer that combines vector paths by union, intersection, difference or xor. The
first path is the subject and the rest are united as the clip. See `fx`.

**Bounce (easing).** An easing curve of a ball falling and rebounding with restitution 0.6 and three
rebounds. An original derivation from free fall. See `anim`.

**Bounding box.** The smallest axis-aligned rectangle around geometry; used for alignment, picking and
the fit of normal maps. See `layout`, `pick`.

**Cage deformer.** A deformer in which content inside a closed polygon follows the polygon's vertices
using mean-value coordinates. See `cage`; also MVC.

**Catmull-Rom spline.** A cubic spline that passes through its control points. The `smooth` easing uses
a non-uniform version through neighbouring keys. See `anim`, `liquid` smoothing in `fx`.

**Channel.** One animated value: a target, a property, a source (keys, expression, noise or driven) and
a blend mode and weight. Channels run in list order. See PROJECT_FORMAT section 8.

**CIE76.** The original colour difference, the Euclidean distance in CIE L*a*b*. Cheap, less accurate
than CIEDE2000. See `percep`.

**CIEDE2000.** The CIE 2000 colour-difference formula (CIE TR 142-2001), implemented as printed in
Sharma, Wu and Dalal (2005) and checked against their published test pairs. Used by animation CI to
judge visible change. See `percep`, `ci`; `docs/CI.md`.

**Clean room.** The development rule that code is written from public standards and textbook methods,
with no copied code and no reproduction of other tools' formats or names. Each technique is logged in
`CLEANROOM.md`.

**Clip.** A reusable take of animation tracks that can be placed on the timeline with speed, loops,
weight, fades and a blend mode. See `clipstack`; PROJECT_FORMAT section 11.1.

**Cloth.** A grid deformer whose vertices move exactly by their own offsets. Also the position-based
dynamics simulation that bakes those offsets. See `cloth`.

**Constraint.** A rule applied after IK that limits a bone: aim, copy rotation, or pin. See `rig`.

**Container (layout).** A flexbox-style one-dimensional layout group with gap, padding, justification,
alignment and wrapping, which positions layers and other containers. See `containers`.

**Copy-rotation constraint.** A constraint that makes a bone match another bone's world rotation. See
`rig`.

**CRDT.** Conflict-free replicated data type: a structure that replicas can edit independently and
merge to the same result without coordination. ARMATURA uses an operation-based CRDT. See `collab`;
ARCHITECTURE section 10. Related: LWW register, RGA, Lamport clock, vector clock, tombstone.

**Cubic Bezier easing.** A CSS-style easing curve defined by two control points between (0,0) and
(1,1). See `anim`.

cage or cloth. See PROJECT_FORMAT section 7.1.

**Delaunay triangulation.** A triangulation of points in which no point lies inside any triangle's
circumcircle, which avoids thin triangles. Built with the Bowyer-Watson algorithm for image meshes.

`focus`. Applied by the `dof` and `dof-export` commands only. See `dof`.

**Determinism.** The property that the same input yields the same output. Frame evaluation is pure;
rendering is byte-identical on one machine and build, not verified across platforms. See
ARCHITECTURE section 6.

**Dope sheet.** A timeline view that shows keys as marks per channel and edits them in time. See
`timeline`, `keyops`.

**Driven key.** A channel whose input is another property's value rather than time, for example elbow
angle to bulge size. See `drivers`; PROJECT_FORMAT section 8.1.

collapsing a vertex, used for mesh simplification. See `lod`.

**Scrub.** Dragging the playhead; the studio caches frames by revision and uses proxies. See `scrub`.

**Skew.** A shear angle in a layer's transform. See PROJECT_FORMAT section 5.1.

**Skin (animation).** A named variant of layers, bones, constraints or IK that can be switched on in a
group, such as costumes. See `skins`.

**Skinning.** Deforming geometry by blending the transforms of bones, weighted per anchor or vertex.
ARMATURA normalizes the weights and treats empty weights as static. See `engine`, `weights`.

**SPDX.** Software Package Data Exchange: a standard way to state a file's licence, as in
`SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0`. Every source file carries one. See `LICENSING.md`.

**Spine deformer.** A deformer that bends geometry along a curve by projecting anchors onto a rest
curve and re-attaching them to the deformed curve. See PROJECT_FORMAT section 7.1.

**Spring (bone).** A damped second-order spring that makes a bone's rotation lag and overshoot; baked at
load so any frame can be evaluated. See PROJECT_FORMAT section 4.4.

frame-by-frame animation and mouth shapes. See PROJECT_FORMAT section 5.4.

**Take.** A named set of tracks that forms a clip's content. See `clipstack`.

still be placed. Compaction removes tombstones every replica has seen. See `collab`.
