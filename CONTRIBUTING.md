# Contributing to OSATURA

* **Independent-implementation rule.** Contribute only code, maths and formats you may legally share. Do not copy from, decompile, or reverse-engineer proprietary tools, files or UIs, and do not paste code from projects whose licence is not compatible (see CLEANROOM.md). Do not read or paste source code of competing tools while writing a feature. Cite the public standard or textbook you implemented from.
* **Licence of contributions (inbound = outbound).** A contribution is accepted under the licence of the part it modifies: MPL-2.0 for `osatura-core`, `-capi`, `-wasm`, `-gpu` and `scripts/`; AGPL-3.0-or-later for `osatura-cli`; CC-BY-4.0 for documentation and synthetic assets. Every source file carries an SPDX line that must equal its crate's `license` (checked by `osatura-cli/tests/spdx_audit.rs`).
* **No relicensing right is granted by the sign-off.** The sign-off below certifies origin only. **A commercial or dual licence (for example a proprietary licence for embedders) is NOT currently possible for contributed code**: it would need a separate Contributor Licence Agreement or an explicit outbound grant from each contributor, and none is in place. Until one exists, nobody (including the maintainer) may claim to be able to relicense other people's contributions.
* **Sign-off (DCO).** Every commit must carry `Signed-off-by: Your Name <email>` (`git commit -s`), certifying the Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1 reproduced below.
* Add tests; run `cargo test --workspace` and `scripts/licence-audit.sh` before opening a pull request.
